# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection - Task 3

This is Task-3 of the **Data Science Internship at HunarIntern**.  
In this task, we worked on detecting breast cancer using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## 📁 Files Included:
- `breast_cancer.csv` – Raw dataset
- `breast_cancer_knn.py` – Python script using KNN classifier
- `README.md` – You're reading it 😉

## 🔧 Steps Performed:
1. Loaded & explored the dataset
2. Cleaned the data if required
3. Prepared features (X) and target (y)
4. Split into training & testing sets
5. Normalized features
6. Trained a KNN model (k=5)
7. Evaluated using classification report & confusion matrix

## 🎯 Model Accuracy:
Achieved **94.7% accuracy** on test data.

## 🧠 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
